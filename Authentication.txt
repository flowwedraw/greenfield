# Authentication

> Learn how to authenticate your Helius API requests

Helius API uses API keys to authenticate requests. Every API request must include your API key as a query string parameter (`api-key=YOUR_API_KEY`) to verify your identity and permissions.

## Getting an API Key

1. Create an account on the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev)
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
3. Click **Create New API Key** and provide a descriptive name for your project

## Security Best Practices

* **Never expose your API key** in client-side code, public repositories, or browser-accessible areas
* Store your API key securely using environment variables or secret management services
* Set up IP restrictions for your API keys when available in the dashboard
* Monitor your API usage in the [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev) to detect unusual patterns
* Consider using different API keys for development and production environments

## Rate Limits

API key usage is subject to rate limits based on your subscription plan. Monitor your usage in the Helius Dashboard to ensure you stay within your allocated limits.
