<h1>Superfood</h1>

<p>I see lots of products labelled as <dfn>superfoods</dfn>. The term <dfn>superfood</dfn> looks like it should mean <dfn>healthy</dfn>, which is a desirable attribute since most of our processed food now is so unhealthy. However, <dfn>superfood</dfn> does not have a formal meaning. It is commonly assumed that it means one of the following:</p>
<h2><dfn>Superfood</dfn> means a complete food</h2>
<p>Something might be a <dfn>superfood</dfn> if it is nutritionally complete.
You can eat this one superfood and nothing else and be completely nourished and healthy.
Such a food does not exist. We need variety.</p>
<h2><dfn>Superfood</dfn> means absolution</h2>
<p>Something might be a <dfn>superfood</dfn> if it can reverse the damage caused by
the unhealthy foods that we consume in mass quantities, so that the consequences of eating junk can be
erased by the purchase of indulgences as a path to dietary absolution.
Unfortunately, this form of penance does not work. The only way to avoid the harm from unhealthy food is to not eat the unhealthy food.</p>
<h2><dfn>Superfood</dfn> is healthy and nutritious</h2>
<p>We used to have a word for things you can eat that are healthy and nutritious. The word was <dfn>food</dfn>. A product that is labelled today as a <dfn>superfood</dfn> is not necessarily healthy and nutritious, just as a product labelled as <dfn>food</dfn> is not necessarily healthy and nutritious. </p>
<p>That is where we are with the Standard American Diet, which is becoming the Standard World Diet. The word <dfn>food</dfn> does not really mean <dfn>food</dfn> anymore. </p>
<p><dfn>Food</dfn> should mean more than just something you can stick in your mouth.</p>
