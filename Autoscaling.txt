# Autoscaling

> Learn how to set up autoscaling to ensure uninterrupted service when you exceed your credit limits.

Autoscaling allows your project to automatically purchase additional credits when you exhaust your monthly allocation, ensuring your applications continue running without interruption.

## How Autoscaling Works

When enabled, autoscaling automatically purchases additional credits in predefined increments when your usage reaches certain thresholds. This prevents service interruptions and maintains consistent performance for your applications.

## Setting Up Autoscaling

Autoscaling can be configured in the Project Settings on your dashboard:

1. Navigate to your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/) and select your project
2. Go to **Project Settings**
3. Find the Autoscaling section
4. Toggle autoscaling on
5. Save your settings

<Note>
  Autoscaling is capped for Developer and Business plans to help manage costs and avoid unexpected charges. If you require unlimited autoscaling, consider upgrading to the **Professional** plan.
</Note>

## Payment Options for Additional Credits

### Card Payment Plans

For projects using credit/debit card payments, autoscaling is the recommended method for handling additional credit needs. When enabled, additional credits will be automatically charged to your payment method.

### Crypto Plans

If you're using cryptocurrency for payments, you'll need to purchase prepaid credits instead of using autoscaling:

1. Log into your [Helius Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/)
2. Select **Buy More Credits**
3. Complete the purchase with your preferred crypto payment method

<Note>
  Prepaid credits activate immediately and never expire—you keep them until they run out.
</Note>

## Pricing for Additional Credits

Additional credit pricing depends on your current plan:

| Plan Type    | Price per Million Additional Credits |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Developer    | \$5 per million                      |
| Business     | \$5 per million                      |
| Professional | \$4 per million                      |

If you're consistently going over your limit, consider upgrading your plan for better rates and unlimited autoscaling.

## Notifications and Tracking Credit Usage

Helius keeps you informed about your credit usage to help manage your spend:

* **Email Alerts**: You'll receive notifications via email when you're approaching your credit limits and when autoscaling occurs.
* **Dashboard Tracking**: Check your current credit usage and historical data directly from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.helius.dev/). Navigate to the **Usage** section to see detailed analytics.

## Autoscaling Limits and Enterprise Options

* **Developer and Business plans**: Autoscaling is available but has predefined caps to avoid unexpectedly large bills.
* **Professional plans**: Autoscaling is unlimited—ideal for rapidly scaling projects.
* **Enterprise plans**: For credit needs exceeding 1B/month, set up an Enterprise plan tailored to your requirements.
