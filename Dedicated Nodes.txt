# Dedicated Nodes

> Dedicated nodes optimized for gRPC streaming - combine with shared plans for full functionality

<Note>
  **Considering streaming data?** [LaserStream](/laserstream) is our recommended solution for most streaming use cases. It offers enhanced reliability, historical replay, auto-reconnection, and multi-node failover without infrastructure management. [Compare LaserStream vs Dedicated Nodes](/laserstream/laserstream-vs-dedicated-nodes) to choose the right solution for your needs.
</Note>

**Dedicated nodes are specifically designed for gRPC streaming applications** and should be combined with a shared plan for comprehensive Solana development needs:

* **gRPC Streaming**: Real-time blockchain data streaming with ultra-low latency
* **Data Monitoring**: Account, transaction, and block updates via Yellowstone Geyser
* **Trading Applications**: High-frequency data feeds for algorithmic trading
* **Analytics**: Real-time blockchain analytics and monitoring

## Node Options

* AMD EPYC 7443p
* AMD EPYC 7543p (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)
* AMD EPYC 9254 (Best for resource-intensive RPC calls)

## Access Includes

* **gRPC streaming** via [Yellowstone Geyser Plugin](/grpc) (primary use case)
* Standard RPC and WebSocket methods (basic functionality only)
* Premium support
* Node clients â€” Agave (recommended) or Jito Labs

## Limitations

<Note>
  **Important**: Dedicated nodes have specific limitations and are not suitable as standalone solutions:

  * **`sendTransaction` Poor Landing Rates**: While supported, not optimized - most transactions will not land
  * **No Archival Data**: Historical data access is not available
  * **`getProgramAccounts` Performance Risk**: While supported, heavy usage can impact node performance or cause node failure
  * **No Platform Features**: APIs, webhooks, and staked connections require a shared plan

  **Recommendation**: Use dedicated nodes for gRPC streaming in combination with a shared paid plan for comprehensive functionality.
