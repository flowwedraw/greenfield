# LaserStream vs Dedicated Nodes: Choosing the Right gRPC Solution

> Compare LaserStream and Dedicated Nodes to choose the best gRPC streaming solution for your needs

## Overview

Both LaserStream and Dedicated Nodes provide gRPC streaming capabilities, but they serve different use cases. This guide helps you choose the right solution based on your specific requirements.

## Quick Recommendation

**LaserStream is the recommended choice for virtually all streaming use cases** due to its superior performance, enhanced reliability, managed infrastructure, and advanced features like historical replay and auto-reconnection. Dedicated nodes are only beneficial when you need isolated credits and rate limits.

## gRPC Streaming Comparison

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**             | ✅ **Superior streaming performance**  | ⚠️ **Can fail under high load**           |
| **Reliability**             | ✅ **Multi-node redundancy**           | ❌ **Single point of failure**             |
| **Historical Replay**       | ✅ **Up to 3000 slots** (\~20 minutes) | ❌ **Not available**                       |
| **Auto-Reconnection**       | ✅ **Built-in with SDK**               | ❌ **Manual implementation required**      |
| **Network Support**         | ✅ **Mainnet + Devnet**                | ⚠️ **Single network (mainnet OR devnet)** |
| **Geographic Distribution** | ✅ **Multiple regions worldwide**      | ⚠️ **Single location**                    |

| **Rate Limits**          | ⚠️ **Has rate limits**          | ✅ **No rate limits**                |
| **Credit Usage**         | ⚠️ **Has credits**              | ✅ **No credits**                    |
| **sendTransaction**      | ✅ **Optimized landing rates**   | ❌ **Poor landing rates**            |
| **Archival Data Access** | ✅ **Available via shared plan** | ❌ **Not available**                 |
| **Platform Features**    | ✅ **APIs, webhooks included**   | ❌ **Requires separate shared plan** |

## When to Choose LaserStream (Pro Plan)

**LaserStream is the best choice for virtually all streaming applications:**

* **High-Performance Trading**: Real-time data feeds with superior performance and reliability
* **Production Applications**: Mission-critical systems that need guaranteed uptime
* **Portfolio Tracking**: Account monitoring, balance updates, transaction history
* **DeFi Analytics**: Protocol monitoring, yield farming data, liquidity tracking
* **NFT Applications**: Collection monitoring, marketplace data, trait analysis
* **Enterprise Solutions**: Professional applications requiring managed infrastructure
* **Development & Testing**: Rapid prototyping and development without infrastructure setup

**Key Advantages:**

* **Superior Performance**: Optimized infrastructure delivers better streaming performance
* **Maximum Reliability**: Multi-node redundancy eliminates single points of failure
* **Zero Downtime**: No risk of node failure under high load
* **Instant Multi-Region Access**: Connect to the closest region worldwide for optimal performance
* **Historical Replay**: Never miss data even after disconnections
* **Enhanced SDK**: Professional-grade connection management and error handling

## When to Choose Dedicated Nodes

**Dedicated Nodes have very limited use cases and are only suitable for:**

* **Credit Pool Isolation**: When you need completely separate credit usage tracking
* **Rate Limit Isolation**: When you need your own isolated rate limit pools

**Important Limitations:**

* **Performance Risk**: Nodes can fail or become unresponsive under high load
* **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy - if the node goes down, you will experience increased latency
* **Cost Considerations**: Higher base cost with different pricing model - evaluate total cost for your usage
* **Limited Features**: Requires separate shared plan for full platform functionality

## Cost Considerations

### LaserStream

* **Professional Plan**: \$999/month base cost
* **Data Usage**: 3 credits per 0.1MB of data
* **Transparent Pricing**: Pay only for the data you actually consume

### Dedicated Nodes

* **Node Cost**: \$2,300+/month depending on specifications
* **Shared Plan Required**: Additional cost for full platform functionality

## Technical Requirements

### LaserStream

```typescript
// Simple integration with enhanced features
import { subscribe, LaserstreamConfig } from 'helius-laserstream';

const config: LaserstreamConfig = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  endpoint: 'https://laserstream-mainnet-ewr.helius-rpc.com'
};

// Automatic reconnection and historical replay
await subscribe(config, subscriptionRequest, handleData, handleError);
```

### Dedicated Nodes

```typescript
// Manual connection management required
import { Client } from '@yellowstone-grpc/client';

const client = new Client(endpoint, undefined, {
  'grpc.keepalive_time_ms': 30000,
  // Custom connection settings...
});

// Manual reconnection logic needed
client.on('error', (error) => {
  // Implement your own reconnection strategy
});
```

## Migration Path

**Moving from Dedicated Nodes**: LaserStream is designed as a drop-in replacement. Simply change your endpoint and API key to migrate.

## Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Do you need the best streaming performance?** → **LaserStream**
2. **Do you want guaranteed uptime and reliability?** → **LaserStream**
3. **Do you want to focus on your application, not infrastructure management?** → **LaserStream**
4. **Do you need historical replay?** → **LaserStream**
5. **Do you specifically need isolated credit pools and rate limits?** → Consider Dedicated Nodes (but weigh the significant downsides)
