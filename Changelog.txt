<Update label="May 2024">
  ## Staked Transactions Are the New Default

  **What's Changed:**

  * **Staked Connections Default**: Transactions sent through Helius now automatically use staked connections by default, providing you with the highest transaction landing rates and optimizing for speed and reliability. No code changes required.
  * **Pricing Update**: Staked connection pricing decreased from 50 to 10 credits per transaction, making it more cost-effective to use our premium transaction infrastructure.

  **Endpoint Changes:**

  * **Staked Endpoint**: The dedicated staked endpoint (`staked.helius-rpc.com`) is being phased out in favor of the regular endpoint which now uses staked connections by default. You can continue using the staked endpoint for now, but we recommend switching to the regular endpoint (`mainnet.helius-rpc.com`) for the best experience.

  **Alternative Options:**

  * **Unstaked Connections**: To continue using unstaked connections (1 credit per call), use `https://unstaked.helius-rpc.com`. Please note that unstaked connections may not be reliable during periods of network congestion.

<Update label="April 2024">
  ## Massive RPC Performance Improvements

  **Big news:** We've reduced latency on all Solana account-based RPC calls by up to 95%!

  **p95 improvements:**

  * [`getProgramAccounts`](/rpc/guides/getprogramaccounts) — 95% faster
  * [`getAccountInfo`](/rpc/guides/getaccountinfo), [`getMultipleAccounts`](/rpc/guides/getmultipleaccounts), [`getBalance`](/rpc/guides/getbalance), [`getSlot`](/rpc/guides/getslot) — 60% faster
  * [`getTokenAccountsByOwner`](/rpc/guides/gettokenaccountsbyowner) — 50% faster

  **Steps to use it:** Nothing! If you use a shared and paid Helius subscription (i.e., not dedicated nodes), you get automatic access.

  **What this means for you:**

  * **Faster dApp loading times**: Account data fetches nearly instantly
  * **Better user experience**: Reduced waiting times for balance checks and token account queries
  * **More efficient development**: Faster iteration cycles when building and testing
  * **Improved scalability**: Handle more concurrent requests with the same infrastructure
