<h1>When I nod my head, you hit it with the hammer</h1>

<p>When I was a kid, I saw a film, probably on television, where one man says to the other:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>When I nod my head, you hit it with the hammer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't remember who said it. Was it Oliver Hardy? Moe Howard? Bud Abott? Chico Marx?
I have been searching for it for years and have not found it. Googling has not been effective.
In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1949815005/wrrrldwideweb/">How JavaScript Works</a>, I attributed it to Bullwinkle,
but I am pretty sure that a human said it first.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT about the origin of "When I nod my head, you hit it with the hammer."
It said that it was said by Sir Ben Kingsley in the 2000 British crime drama film <i>Sexy Beast</i>.
This was certainly not the first use, but in ChatGPT's defense,  it does not see a lot of movies.</p>
<p>I asked about the world's funniest joke. It offered this:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses.
    He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed.
    The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services.
    He gasps: 'My friend is dead! What can I do?'
    The operator says: 'Calm down, I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead.'
    There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard.
    Back on the phone, the guy says: 'OK, now what?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I say</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>That joke kills at NRA meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then it delivers this hysterical bon mot:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I cannot confirm or deny whether the joke I mentioned is popular at NRA  meetings, as I do not have access to such information. However, it's  worth noting that jokes and humor can be used in various contexts and  settings, including political and social gatherings. It's important to  remember that humor, like any form of expression, can be both positive  and negative, and its appropriateness and impact can depend on a variety  of factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT cracks me up.</p>
