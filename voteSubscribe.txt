# voteSubscribe

> Subscribe to receive notification anytime a new vote is observed in gossip. These votes are pre-consensus therefore there is no guarantee these votes will enter the ledger.

<Note>
  This subscription is unstable and only available if the validator was started with the `--rpc-pubsub-enable-vote-subscription` flag. The format of this subscription may change in the future.
</Note>

## Endpoints

Websockets are available on mainnet and devnet with the following URLs:

* **Mainnet** `wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`
* **Devnet** `wss://devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Note>Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; implementing health checks and sending pings every minute is heavily recommended to keep the websocket connection alive.</Note>
