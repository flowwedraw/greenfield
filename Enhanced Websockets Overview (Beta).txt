# Enhanced Websockets Overview (Beta)

> Stream real-time transaction and account updates directly to your applications with our enhanced websocket integration.

## What are Enhanced Websockets?

Helius provides Enhanced WebSockets in addition to Solana's standard WebSocket methods. These enhanced WebSockets offer faster response times than traditional WebSockets. We support two subscription methods: `transactionSubscribe` and `accountSubscribe`.

<Info>
  This feature is available exclusively for **business and professional plans**. Please note that this is the **Enhanced WebSocket**, not **Yellowstone Geyser**. For Yellowstone Geyser functionality, a [**Dedicated Node**](/dedicated-nodes/) is required.
</Info>

## Subscription Endpoints

Geyser-enhanced WebSockets are currently available on `mainnet` and `devnet` with the following URLs

**Mainnet:** `wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

**Devnet:** `wss://atlas-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API_KEY>`

<Warning>
  Websockets have a 10-minute inactivity timer; to keep the WebSocket connection alive, it is highly recommended that health checks be implemented and that pings be sent every minute.
</Warning>
