# FAQ

> Have a question about Helius webhooks?

## What is the retry policy for webhooks?

Currently, we resend unacknowledged webhook events once per minute for three minutes. We also offer customizable retry policies for enterprise plans.

## When does the Webhook send a notification?

Webhooks notify as soon as a transaction is confirmed.

## What is the difference between "raw" and "enhanced" webhooks?

Raw webhooks are regular Solana transactions. When a transaction occurs for the given addresses in a raw webhook, those transactions will be directly sent to the webhook URL supplied by the user.\
\
Enhanced webhooks are for Helius' interpreted transaction types. We parse over 100 types of Solana transactions, including NFT listings, DeFi swaps, Solana transfers, etc., and abstract these into our own schema. If you want to listen for any transaction and don't want Helius abstractions, use raw webhooks. If you want built-in transaction type detectio&#x6E;**, use enhanced webhooks.**

## **Are webhooks available on Devnet?**

Yes!

## How many addresses can I input for 1 webhook?

Up to 100,000 addresses.

## How can I verify that the webhook came from Helius?

You can specify an authorization header when creating (or updating) a webhook. Helius will include set the value in the `Authorization` header when sending data to your webhook.

## Can I input "localhost" for my webhook URL?

No! This is a very common mistake. We can not detect your own local servers from just "localhost."

## Can I monitor an entire NFT collection?

Yes, you can! See the [Helius SDK](https://github.com/helius-labs/helius-sdk#collection-webhooks) for a code example.

## Do webhooks post failed transactions?

It depends on the type. Enhanced webhooks do not, but raw webhooks do!
